  ## Description
  
  - This is my second homework assignment using NODE.js for the Full Stack Web Developer course I'm enrolled in. The assigment was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a Team Profile HTML page from input provided by the user.
  - The application lets the user add information for a Manager, Engineer, and Intern team member.
  - By completing this assignment, I was able to implement lessons from my course, including: Set Jest.js test, Code JavaScript for Node.js application, Establish a parent Class and then later extend it to other new Classes, Implement several JS modules, work with a CSS framework, and apply Inquirer.js for the user interface on the command-line.
  - See the Usage Information of this README for a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the appication's functionality.
  

  The following are screenshots of the final version of the application in the terminal and a sample HTML page generated by the command-line application.
